# Overview:

This is a simple, interactive combat game built using Python and Pygame, offering a fun grid-based combat experience between a human player and an AI opponent. Players can select difficulty levels (Easy, Moderate, Hard), place their ships, and engage in strategic turn-based attacks, all within a visually appealing UI rendered via Pygame.

# Key Features:

# Concepts Used:
- Programming Language: Python 3.X
- Libraries: Pygame ( for graphics, events, rendering ), NumPy( for Grid ) 

Core Concepts:
<br> ❇️⁠ Event-driven programming
<br> ❇️ Grid generation using NumPy
<br> ❇️⁠ Collision handling (mouse clicks & grid mapping)
<br> ❇️ Turn-based state machine logic
<br> ❇️ AI logic with random attack generation

# How to use:

🔧 Setup:

<br> 1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
<br> 2. Install Pygame if not already:
```python
pip install pygame
```

▶️ Run the Game:

<br> 1. Copy the source code from the file : [src.py](https://github.com/DeviprasadShetty9833/The_Conquerer/blob/main/src.py)
<br> 2. Paste the code on a Python file & save it as ' **The Conquerer.py** '.

🎮 Controls:

<br> 1. Click on the grid boxes on Left board to place your ships( BLUE boxes ).
<br> 2. Click on grid boxes on Right board to fire shots on AI's ships( GREEN dots ).
